# Abyssal Idle - Game Design

## Elevator Pitch
A cozy-to-unsettling idle management game about a seaside cannery that scales into industrial overfishing. Start by manually catching fish and tinning small batches, then automate the loop. Your choices determine whether the ocean collapses or survives.

## Player Fantasy
- Run a quaint cannery that grows into a massive operation.
- Experience a tone shift: cozy early game, eerie late game.
- Decide between fast profit and long-term sustainability.

## Core Loop (Early Game)
1) Catch fish via a simple timing minigame.
2) Choose how to process fish (raw, smoked, fermented, aged, skinned).
3) Add ingredients (garlic, chili, oil, etc.).
4) Tin the fish and sell.
5) Buy upgrades and expand automation.

## Automation Philosophy
- Automation replaces actions, not thinking.
- Tiers: manual -> crew auto-plays minigame -> faster/better crews -> auto processing -> simple threshold toggles.
- No programmable logic or complex automation rules.

## Progression Phases
### Phase 1: Cozy Start
- Manual fishing minigame.
- Simple processing.
- Sell fish or tins.

### Phase 2: Cannery Unlock
- Tinning becomes primary income.
- Basic processing automation.
- Ingredient sourcing begins (buy/farm).

### Phase 3: Industrial Growth
- Faster crews and throughput upgrades.
- Ocean health starts to visibly decline.
- Narrative logs become unsettling.

### Phase 4: The Line
- Choices become explicit: exploit vs sustain.
- Sustainable upgrades slow profit but protect ocean health.

### Phase 5: Ending
- Overfishing ending: ecosystem collapses, output falls to zero.
- Sustainable ending: balanced system, final descent, closure.

## Systems
### Resources
- Fish (by species later).
- Tins.
- Money.
- Ingredients (garlic, chili, oil, salt).

### Crew Trips
- Player clicks “Send Crew” on the main screen.
- Crew returns after a timer; fish are awarded on return only.
- Upgrades affect trip duration and catch amount.

### Processing Methods
- Raw, smoked, fermented, aged, skinned.
- Each method affects value and tone.

### Market
- Sell fish or tins.
- Upgrade to sell multiple fish per tick.

### Ocean Health (Sustainability)
- Hidden early, becomes visible midgame.
- Decreases as automation scale increases.
- Unlocks endings based on threshold and duration.

## Tone Shift
- Copy changes over time: fish names, tin labels, logbook entries.
- Cozy UI becomes subtly distorted in late game (minimal art required).

## Endings
### Ending A: Overfished
- Ocean health hits 0 and stays there.
- Production collapses, quiet end credits.

### Ending B: Sustainable
- Maintain ocean health above threshold while reaching final milestone.
- Final descent reveals a stable equilibrium.

## Future Notes
- Crew members can visit and apply for jobs with stats and specialties.
- Boats have limited slots; upgrades increase crew capacity.

## Monetization / Scope
- 6-12 months solo dev.
- One-time purchase on Steam.
- Clear ending in 4-8 hours.
