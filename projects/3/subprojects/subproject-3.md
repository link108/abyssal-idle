## Checklist

- [x] Validate that non-prestige runs are impractically slow but possible
- [x] Adjust thresholds or scaling to hit pacing goals
- [x] Document final thresholds in code comments or a tuning section

## Update Instructions
- Check off items as you complete them.
- When all items are complete, mark this subproject as complete in `projects/3/project.md`.
