# Milestone 1 — Foundational Run + Optional Prestige Unlock

## Goal
Implement the complete base loop with crew fishing, selling fish, cannery unlock and tinning, selling tins, optional prestige availability after 100 tins sold (per run), and required save/load.

## Scope Notes
- Ocean health can exist internally but does not need to be visible.
- Reputation and MetaState exist only as the minimum needed to prestige and carry forward permanent bonuses.
- Per-run counters reset on new game and on prestige.

## How To Use This Project File
