# Milestone 3 — Endings (All Require Prestige)

## Goal
Implement three endings with distinct pacing and conditions. Prestige is not a hard requirement but should make these endings realistically attainable.

## How To Use This Project File
- This file is the master checklist for Milestone 3.
- Each subproject has its own checklist. As items are completed, update the subproject file.
- When a subproject is fully complete, mark it done here and note the completion date.
- When the final subproject is done, ensure every item in this checklist is checked.

## Subprojects
- `planning/3/subplanning/subproject-1.md` — Ending conditions + run state
- `planning/3/subplanning/subproject-2.md` — Ending UI + summaries
