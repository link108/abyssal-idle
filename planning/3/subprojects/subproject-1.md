## Goal
Add end-state tracking and implement triggers for all three endings.

## Checklist
- [x] Define run end-state enum or state machine
- [x] Implement Industrial Collapse trigger (ocean health 0 + production threshold)
- [x] Implement Sustainable Equilibrium trigger (health above threshold for duration + production)
- [x] Implement Dual Mastery trigger (high production + high health + quality ceiling)
- [x] Ensure endings are checked centrally (GameState) not scattered in UI

## Update Instructions
- Check off items as you complete them.
- When all items are complete, mark this subproject as complete in `planning/3/project.md`.
